# End to End MLOPS Project with ETL Pipeline - Building Network Security Project using Phishing Dataset


This project demonstrates an End-to-End MLOps pipeline using a phishing dataset.The pipeline encompasses data ingestion, validation, transformation, model training, evaluation, and deployment, The goal of the project is to build a robust machine learning model to detect phishing websites using a complete MLOps setup, ensuring that it can be maintained, versioned, and deployed in production with ease.

The pipeline integrates tools and frameworks like MLflow, DagsHub, MongoDB, FastAPI, Docker, and GitHub Actions to automate processes like model training, deployment, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). automating everything from data ingestion to model deployment. This project focused on the MLOps lifecycle, leveraging powerful tools of machine learning workflows

## Project Overview

* Data Ingestion: Load raw phishing data from CSV files and store it in MongoDB for easy access and scalability.
* Data Validation: Ensure the data's integrity by checking for missing values, duplicates, or outliers.
* Data Transformation: Clean the data and apply feature engineering techniques (e.g., scaling, encoding, or feature extraction).
* Model Training: Train machine learning models using different algorithms and tune hyperparameters.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models based on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
* Deployment: Expose the trained model through a FastAPI application to make predictions on new phishing data.
* MLOps Automation: Track experiments and models using MLflow and manage the entire pipeline with DagsHub. Dockerize the application for portability.
